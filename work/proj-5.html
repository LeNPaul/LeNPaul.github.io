<h4>Front End Development Certificate</h4>

<p>As of now, I am in the process of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lenpaul/" target="_blank">looking for work as a front end developer</a> in Toronto, Canada. In the meantime, I am currently working on completing <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/lenpaul" target="_blank">the Front End Development Certificate from Free Code Camp</a>, which involves a wide variety of front end development projects, some of which I have showcased above. After that, I hope to get started on the Back End Development Certificate.</p>

<h4>Data Analysis</h4>

<p>I am currently in the process of analysing and exploring what factors affect the results of an Olympic weightlifter. Using data gathered from the <a href="http://www.iwf.net/" target="_blank">International Weightlifting Federation's</a> website, I generated a few graphs with Python's Matplotlib library comparing a number of variables affecting a weightlifter's results at the Olympics.</p>
