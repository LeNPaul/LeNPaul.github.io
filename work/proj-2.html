title: 'Lagrange Jekyll Theme'
---
<p>Lagrange is a minimalist Jekyll blog theme that I built from scratch, powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, a static website generator, and <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. The purpose of this theme is to provide a simple, clean, content-focused blogging platform for your personal site or blog. This theme is currently being used by about a hundred people, with this number growing every day. Check out <a href="https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange" target="_blank">the demo</a>, where youâ€™ll also find instructions on <a href="https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange/journal/Installation-Guide.html" target="_blank">how to install</a> and <a href="https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange/journal/Working-With-Lagrange.html" target="_blank">use the theme</a>.</p>
