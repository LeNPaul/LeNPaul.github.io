title: 'Millennial Jekyll Theme'
---
<p>Millennial is another minimalist <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> theme powered by <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> that I built from scratch, similar to Lagrange, except that this theme was made for running an online publication. The purpose is to provide a simple, clean, distraction-free platform for delivering content. Check out <a href="https://lenpaul.github.io/Millennial/" target="_blank">the demo</a>, where youâ€™ll also find instructions on <a href="https://lenpaul.github.io/Millennial/documentation/Installation-Guide.html">how to use install</a> and use the theme.</p>
