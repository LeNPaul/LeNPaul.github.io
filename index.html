        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Paul!</h1>
				<p>As a fourth year physics student at McMaster University, my curiosity and love of learning extends far beyond what am taught in class. I always enjoy expanding my perspectives about the world, and learning new things that did not know about before. In particular, I enjoy the learning process, and being able to do something that I was not able to do before through practice and hard work. In my time so far at McMaster University, I have been involved with a wide variety of organizations ranging from McMaster Undergraduate Physics Society, McMaster Juggling Club, to McMusic Together. In all of these organizations, I have focused on motivating others to learn and to push their limits of what they can do, and have myself learned many new things in the process. I am always open to helping others. If you wish to contact me, please do so at: (647)-859-7625 l.nguyen.paul@gmail.com</p>
