title: "Weightlifting Data Analysis"
---

<p>I am currently in the process of analysing and exploring what factors affect the results of an Olympic weightlifter. Using data gathered from the <a href="http://www.iwf.net/" target="_blank">International Weightlifting Federation's</a> website, I generated a few graphs with Python's Matplotlib library comparing a number of variables affecting a weightlifter's results at the Olympics.</p>
