title: "Front End Development Certificate"
---

I am proud to say that I have finally completed <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/" target="_blank">Free Code Camp's</a> Front End Development Certificate! I started working on this curriculum last summer in May of 2016, and by the end of August I was working on the 'Intermediate Algorithm Scripting' portion of the curriculum, having completed the all of the 'Intermediate Front End Development Projects' portion. I started university classes again in September, and so I decided to put working on this certificate on hold until I had more time. This ended up being the following summer, eight months later, where I finally completed all of the required curriculum. In total, this certificate is estimated to take around 500 hours to complete.

Although it is very satisfying to be able to say that I have officially completed this certificate, really, it was the experience gained through completing this certificate that is the most valuable thing, not the certificate itself. In many ways, I believe this is what education is all about - the experiences that you gain by working towards something, not the certificate that you get at the end.

As of now, I am in the process of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lenpaul/" target="_blank">looking for work as a front end developer</a> in Toronto, Canada. In the meantime, I am currently working on completing the next step in Free Code Camp's curriculum, which is the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/lenpaul" target="_blank"> Back End Development Certificate</a>, while working on a few personal projects of mine. Although finishing the Front End Development Certificate is a huge step for me in becoming a software developer, I am still learning, and have a long way to go.
