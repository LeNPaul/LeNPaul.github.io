title: "Jekyll Themes"
---

Ever since I discovered [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), one of the more popular static website generators used by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), I have used Jekyll as my go-to for building simple, fast, static websites. Not only has building Jekyll themes from scratch helped me learn a lot about web development, it is also a great outlet for me to design and build websites. As of now, the following are my current themes that I have.

{% include image.html url="https://lenpaul.github.io/Millennial/" image="/projects/proj-3/millennial-full.jpg" %}

{% include image.html url="https://lenpaul.github.io/portfolio-website/" image="/projects/proj-4/portfolio-home.jpg" %}

I am currently working on building another theme that will be focus on offering a simple template for professors or teachers to host their course websites. From my experience, professors and teachers typically spend minimal time on their course websites (they're usually just HTML pages with no CSS styling at all), which sometimes ends up being a bad experience for students.
