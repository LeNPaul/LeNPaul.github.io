<p>This is my personal portfolio theme that I built from the ground up, using the  <a href="http://devtipsstarterkit.com/" target="_blank">DevTips Starter Kit</a> as a foundation for starting, and following closely the amazing tutorial by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6jKLsxbFg4&list=PL0CB3OvPhDA_STygmp3sDenx3UpdOMk7P" target="_blank">Travis Neilson over at DevTips</a>. Since you are already viewing this site, you might be more interested in viewing  <a href="https://github.com/LeNPaul/portfolio-website" target="_blank">the source code</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/LeNPaul/portfolio-website/fork" target="_blank">forking the repository</a>, if you are interested in using this site yourself.</p>
